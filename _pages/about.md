Hi there! My name is WU Qi. I go by Qi or Dominique. 

I am a first-year PhD student in Linguistics at University of Connecticut. I work on Syntax and its interface with Morphology and Pragmatics. 

You can find my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BugE9LCbHaJQa_WkYQlRdiu1W7ihvZSF/view?usp=drive_link) here.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
